# katapult:NOW 
# a manifesto for a desirable future 

Abraham Lincoln supposedly said that "the best way to predict your future is to create it". **We are by no means setting out to predicting a specific future, but we are all set on describing one worth creating.**

Many people have thought deeply about the details and implications of the future we are trying to describe here. We don't want to repeat all these arguments here. Instead, we aim to distill and build on them, linking to the original ideas where appropriate.

The purpose of this manifesto is to describe a common objective that is worth fighting and working for and that has the potential to set us as the human race on a common path towards a great future.

We still have many challenges to solve and the most important ones are well described and packaged into a framework as the [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.globalgoals.org/) [SDGs], [but we have already shown that we know how to solve the most pressing problems humanity faced over millennia: plague, war and famine. We have not solved these completely, but the numbers show that we can, if we want to.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow)

But before we set out to describe our vision of the best possible future, we need to lay the foundations by describing our underlying beliefs. 

## Underlying Beliefs

### Moral/Ethical Foundations

We believe in the categorical imperative of Kant: "Act always on that maxim which you can, at the same time, will should be universal law."

### Equality

We believe in equality of all human beings. 

### Transparency

We believe that transparency is the foundation of any working ecosystem. 

### Human touch / Nature / Selfmade

We believe that it is essential for human beings to do things and produce with our hands.

### Meaning

We believe that human beings want to be connected to something that has a higher meaning than themselves.

### Social 

We believe that human beings crave interaction with other human beings.

### Economy 

We believe that the purpose of economic systems is to match supply and demand.


### Technology

We believe that we are systemically intertwined with technology and will are not able to end technology or roll back developments without considerable cost. 

### Moore's Law

We believe in exponential growth of computational performance. We do not expect the current computational paradigms to fulfil this, but assume that new paradigms like quantum computing will not only increase the overall performance but also help to explore entirely new ways of thinking about computation. 

### Exponential growth

We believe that technologies like CrispR, Blockchain, Robots, Bots, AI, VR, Augmented Reality, and so on all inherit from Moore's Law and therefor also follow exponential growth (and sometimes contribute towards it).


### Automation

We believe that everything that can be automated will be automated. We see this happening in two domains: motor-skills, in the form of robots, and cognitive skills, in the form of artificial intelligence.


### Everything is connected

We believe that everything that can be connected, will be connected. While this is easy to imagine for machines, both hard- and software based, we also see this happening for living organism like human beings. This first happens in the form of external sensors, followed by implants.

### Time and space dissolves

We believe that we will not only create decoupling of time by allowing asynchronous communication over networks, but even extend this into the realm of experience and hardware by technology like virtual reality or 3D-printing.


### Trust is institutionalised

We believe that trust and selective transparency will be part of the infrastructure of a fully connected and automated world. One of the first signs of how this might work are blockchain based systems that allow to rethink collaborative ecosystems from the ground up.

### We can edit life

We believe that we will be able to modify the plan for life in living organisms and write new code for entirely new organisms. The first steps in this direction are being taken with technologies like [CrispR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR).


### Energy production

We believe that energy production will be fully decentralised and the cost of energy will be close to zero or zero. 




## Milk and Honey:  ***Sketches of the future we want to work for***

### Economic System
> This domain describes how a society produces and then distributes its limited resources.

Machines keep an index of all available resources on the planet. Where possible, like in agriculture, they also actively produce resources. The energy needed for the machines to function is fully renewable and sustainable and its sources are being cared for and extended as needed by machines. 

The also know how to create consumable goods from resources either by means of robotic production, genetic engineering or some form or 3D printing. 

And they can distribute these goods across the globe autonomously to the place where they are needed. 

They calculate how to distribute the resources based on signals they receive directly from living and inanimate entities. The source of the signal are both hard - mechanical or biological markers - as well as soft - system state of a software or a brain. 

There is no need for work in the sense of of the late 20th century. All human activity is concentrated on governance, culture and social interaction.

Since the supply and demand is handled extremely efficiently, to the individual it feels like resources were abundant.

### State or Political System
> This domain describes the institutions in a particular society that have a legitimate monopoly on violence, force, and power and thus can organize the society.   

Since the economy is truly global, the governance must be global as well. The machines that manage our global economy need steering by means of binding codified contracts. These contracts must be created and changed by humans. The discourse that creates the foundations of these contracts is open to everyone on the planet. We are assisted by machines in making sense of the enormous data we are collecting from various inputs such as speech, written text and sentiment collected directly from our brains. 
The results are fed back into systems that form contracts for the machines that are tested against a human created set of tests to ensure they do what they were intended to do. 

Disputes between people are handled in a similar fashion. Judges are no single people, but a wide range of people from all over the globe who receive all data associated with the dispute - except the identity of the people involved -  and are assisted by machines in their personal sense-making. They feed back their verdict into an algorithm that processes all incoming verdicts. This algorithm has been created in a similar fashion as the algorithms that steer our economy. 

### Cultural System
> The stores of information, including the imagery and media of expression that binds a group, are passed through generations. The cultural system of a society creates a sense of meaning: a vision that allows humans to understand the past, present, and future, and their role in time/place.    

We spend our time mostly in participating in our global politcal system, socialising with other beings, learning new things and expressing ourselves.

Since we are all interconnected with all other human beings and machines on the planet, we not only have the possibility to interact with all of them, but also to create new forms of expression all with the aim of understanding ourselves better and giving other entities the chance to understand us better.

The interactions and expression can both take place in the physical and the digital space. We can transition smoothly between the two and can distinguish between the two. Especially when it comes to fulfilling needs that can only be fulfilled in one of these spaces, we are very clear about these distinctions. 

A core element of our culture is that everyone knows exactly what her current main objective in life is. Everyone is free to change their objective at any given moment in time, but it is well defined, articlulated and public.

### Social System
> How we live, learn, raise our children 

Everyone on the planet has access to a comfortable home with sanitation, running water and electricity to run appliances for cooking, cooling, warming, etc.    
While these homes are highly individual, they are also extremely adaptable to the current circumstances of their inhabtiants. If additional space is needed, it is easy to add - and just as easy to remove if not needed anymore. The entire space can also be transferred easily to other places on the planet or onto other places in the universe where people live.

Learning is not something that is artificially limited to certain times in a persons live. Everyone learns constantly and shares their knowledge with other people in order to increase everyones shared knowledge. This is reflected in the way we learn. We have places we can go to in order to have assistance by other people that already know what we want to learn. These places can be in the digital or physical space. We are assisted by machines in helping us understand what foundations we must lay down in order to obtain the knowledge or skill we want to acquire. This starts at a very early age with reading, writing, calculating and other basic skills needed for building a wide array of knowledge.

We can decide on a very individual basis on how we want to live, given that we don't inflict pain on anyone else. While the society is very egalitarian, it is also highly individual.


## THE CANARY IN PARADISE: ***An early warning system for dystopia***

> There are a wide range of possible futures. Some of those futures are undesireable from our point of view. Instead of describing these, we describe the most important warning signals of things that potentially would lead into this kind of future.
